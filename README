Pizza PHP is an open source Model-View-Controller PHP framework that's 
hotter than a pizza fresh out the oven!

Inspired by my years of experience with writing PHP applications and
other frameworks like Code Igniter and Ruby on Rails, Pizza PHP is
designed to quickly and easily give you structure to your new PHP
application and to offer libraries with commonly used functions.

It is not meant to replace a framework such as Zend, but is instead meant
to complement larger frameworks and your own code.


Pizza PHP is in early days (and hence the complete lack of documentation),
but so far Pizza PHP offers the following features:

- The ability to organise your code into themes, controllers, views and
libraries.

- Clean, human-readable URLs in the format /page/param1/param2/param3...

- Routing, so you can still give your parameters meaningful names in your
controllers and views. Also allows you to change which controller, view or
theme to load for each page, and even load a different file based on the
number of parameters received.

- Database wrapper library for cleaner, easier access to a MySQL database
so you can do your database accesses in far fewer lines of code.

- Debug mode so you can hide all of your debugging print statements by changing
one setting. However, you can still log important events to the database, all
on the same line.



The Pizza PHP software is released open source under New BSD.

However, if you do decide to add additions to the software, it would be
much appreciated if these changes were offered back to the original 
development repository under the New BSD license.
